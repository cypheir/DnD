  __SUBSTANCE PUSHING (CYPHBREW)_________________________________________
    (Insight, Investigation/Perception/Deception)

      Acquiring Substances (Crime + Buying)

        DC:
          A Wisdom (Insight), followed by the character's choice one of the
          following: Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Perception), or
          Charisma (Deception).

          First you must earn a good deal. While you do this, you must avoid
          being caught.

        Resources:

          Finding the right wholesale dealer requires one workweek of effort
          and 50 gp in expenses. Spending more time and money increases your
          chance of finding a better dealer. Add +1 to your Wisdom (Insight)
          check for each additional workweek spent and +1 for each additional
          50 gp spent up to maximum of +10 for each.

        Resolution:

          A character seeking to buy substances makes a Wisdom (Insight) check
          to determine the quality of the seller found.

          As a further option to reflect regional availability, the GM can
          apply a negative or positive modifier to the required check.
          Furthermore, you can double substance costs in areas of low
          availability.

          Using the Buying Substances table, you can determine what is
          available for the character to buy. Then use the Substance Pricing
          table to assign prices to the items, based on their rarity.

              BUYING SUBSTANCES
              ―――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
              Check      Available Inventory (oz.)

              10-15      (1d6)          -             -
              16-20      (1d4 x 4)      -             -
              21-25      x5 ->          (1d4 x 4)     -
              26-30      x5 ->          (2d10 x 3)    -
              31-35      x5 ->          x5 ->         (1d6)
              36+        x5 ->          x5 ->         (1d4 x 4)

                Low       =  1d6 oz.
                Moderate  =  1d4 x 4 oz.
                Plentiful =  2d10 x 3 oz.

              SUBSTANCE PRICING
              ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
              Rarity       Street Price/oz.     Acquired Price/oz.
              ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
              Common           50 gp                (1d10 x 5) gp
              Uncommon        200 gp               (2d10 x 10) gp
              Rare          2,000 gp              (2d10 x 100) gp

          You have the final say in determining which items are for sale and
          their final price, no matter what the tables say.

          If a character seeks a specific substance, first make sure it's
          available in that area. If so, include the desired item for sale on
          a check of 15 or higher for common, 25 or higher for uncommon, and
          45 or higher for rare.

          After the character finalizes his purchase use the Shopping Cart
          Value table to determine the value of the character's Intelligence
          (Investigation), Wisdom (Perception), or Charisma (Deception) check.

              SHOPPING CART VALUE
              ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
              DC       Weight
              ――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――
              5          1 oz.
              10        16 oz. (1 lb.)
              15        64 oz. (4 lbs.)
              20       128 oz. (8 lbs.)
              25       256 oz. (16 lbs.)
              30       512 oz. (32 lbs.)

          As a further option to reflect variable local law enforcement or
          social acceptance of the substance, the GM can apply a negative or
          positive modifier to the required check.

          If only the one first check is successful, the character purchases
          the desired product but loses it upon escaping a mishap.

          If only the second check is successful, the character finds no
          substance dealers but also raises no suspicion.

          If both checks are unsuccessful, the character is caught and jailed.
          The character must pay a fine equal to the street value of all
          substances on hand and must spend one week in jail for each 25 gp
          of the fine.

          If both checks are successful, the character purchases the desired
          product successfully.

        Complications:

          Roll for complications if...
            - Both DC's failed
            - One roll failed, and has a rival involved in law or crime.

          Acquiring substances can be filled with complications. Roll on the
          Acquiring Substances Complications table (or create a complication
          of your own) if the character fails both checks. If the character’s
          rival is involved in crime or law enforcement, a complication ensues
          if the character fails either check.

      Slanging Product (Carousing + Selling)

        DC: Charisma (Persuasion)

        Resources:
          Substance pushing, or product slanging covers a workweek of fine
          food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to
          entice lower-, middle-, or upper-class folk to buy product. A
          character can blend in with the lower class for 10 gp to cover
          expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class. Pushing amongst the upper
          class requires 250 gp for the workweek and access to the local
          nobility.

          A character with the noble background can mingle with the upper
          class, but other characters can do so only if you judge that the
          character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character
          might use a disguise kit and the Deception skill to pass as a noble
          visiting from a distant city.

        Resolution:
          After a workweek of substance pushing, a character stands to reach
          customers within the selected social class. The character makes a
          Charisma (Persuasion) check using the Substance Pushing table.

          Substance buyers are NPC customers who will discretely buy grey
          market goods from the character when offered. A hostile contact is
          a person who, for one reason or another, now bears a grudge against
          the pusher. A hostile contact works against the character, placing
          obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act.

          (1) Lower—class (10gp/week) customers include criminals, laborers,
          mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who normally
          frequent the cheapest taverns in town. They can afford common
          rarity drugs.

            *Note: For each workweek you are selling to the Lower-class, you
            can also preform the Acquiring Substances activity. This will
            double your risk of complications and only work with the
            Lower-class.

          (2) Middle-class (50gp/week) customers include guild members,
          spell-casters, town officials, and other folk who frequent well—kept
          establishments. They can afford up to uncommon rarity drugs and more
          of them.

          (3) Upper-class (250gp/week) customers are nobles and their personal
          servants. Providing goods to such folk at formal banquets, state
          dinners, and the like. They can afford any amount of drugs, but
          only the rarest of drugs can serve as a status symbol.
