  __SUBSTANCE PUSHING (CYPHBREW)_________________________________________
    (Insight, Investigation/Perception/Deception)

      Acquiring Substances (Crime + Buying)

        DC:
          A Wisdom (Insight), followed by the character's choice one of the 
          following: Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Perception), or 
          Charisma (Deception).

          First you must earn a good deal. While you do this, you must avoid 
          being caught.

        Resources:

          Finding the right wholesale dealer requires one workweek of effort 
          and 50 gp in expenses. Spending more time and money increases your 
          chance of finding a better dealer. Add +1 to your Wisdom (Insight) 
          check for each additional workweek spent and +1 for each additional 
          50 gp spent up to maximum of +10 for each.

          A character seeking to buy substances makes a Wisdom (Insight) 
          check to determine the quality of the seller found.

          As a further option to reflect regional availability, the GM can 
          apply a negative or positive modifier to the required check. 
          Furthermore, you can double substance costs in areas of low 
          availability.

          Using the Buying Substances table, you can determine what is 
          available for the character to buy. Then use the Substance Pricing 
          table to assign prices to the items, based on their rarity.

          You have the final say in determining which items are for sale and 
          their final price, no matter what the tables say.

          If a character seeks a specific substance, first make sure it's 
          available in that area. If so, include the desired item for sale on 
          a check of 15 or higher for common, 25 or higher for uncommon, and 
          45 or higher for rare.

          After the character finalizes his purchase use the Shopping Cart 
          Value table to determine the value of the character's Intelligence 
          (Investigation), Wisdom (Perception), or Charisma (Deception) 
          check.

          As a further option to reflect variable local law enforcement or 
          social acceptance of the substance, the GM can apply a negative or 
          positive modifier to the required check.

          If both checks are unsuccessful, the character is caught and jailed. 
          The character must pay a fine equal to the street value of all 
          substances on hand and must spend one week in jail for each 25 gp of 
          the fine.

          If only one first check is successful, the character purchases the 
          desired product but loses it upon escaping a mishap.

          If only the second check is successful, the character finds no 
          substance dealers but also raises no suspicion.

          If both checks are successful, the character purchases the desired 
          product successfully.

        Complications:

          Roll for complications if...
            - Both DC's failed
            - One roll failed, and has a rival involved in law or crime.

          Acquiring substances can be filled with complications. Roll on the 
          Acquiring Substances Complications table (or create a complication 
          of your own) if the character fails both checks. If the character’s 
          rival is involved in crime or law enforcement, a complication ensues 
          if the character fails either check.

      Slanging Product (Carousing + Selling)

        DC: Charisma (Persuasion)

        Resources:
          Substance pushing, or product slanging covers a workweek of fine 
          food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to 
          entice lower-, middle-, or upper-class folk to buy product. A 
          character can blend in with the lower class for 10 gp to cover 
          expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class. Pushing amongst the upper 
          class requires 250 gp for the workweek and access to the local 
          nobility.

          A character with the noble background can mingle with the upper 
          class, but other characters can do so only if you judge that the 
          character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character 
          might use a disguise kit and the Deception skill to pass as a noble 
          visiting from a distant city.

        Resolution:
          After a workweek of substance pushing, a character stands to reach 
          customers within the selected social class. The character makes a 
          Charisma (Persuasion) check using the Substance Pushing table.

          Substance buyers are NPC customers who will discretely buy grey 
          market goods from the character when offered. A hostile contact is a 
          person who, for one reason or another, now bears a grudge against the 
          pusher. A hostile contact works against the character, placing 
          obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act.

          Lower—class (1) (10gp/week) customers include criminals, laborers, 
          mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who normally frequent 
          the cheapest taverns in town. They can afford common rarity drugs.

          Middle-class (2) (50gp/week) customers include guild members, 
          spell-casters, town officials, and other folk who frequent well—kept 
          establishments. They can afford up to uncommon rarity drugs and more 
          of them.

          Upper-class (3) (250gp/week) customers are nobles and their personal 
          servants. Providing goods to such folk at formal banquets, state 
          dinners, and the like. They can afford any rarity drugs, and only the 
          rarest drugs can serve as a status symbol.
